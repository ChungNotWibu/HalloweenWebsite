        <h1>About Halloween (31/10) :</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>● What is Halloween :</h2>
        <br>
        <p>ㅤㅤ All Hallows' Evening (Halloween for short) is commonly known as the "Devil's Festival". In fact, Halloween
            is a traditional and special festival in the West, it is usually celebrated every year on October 31, before
            the Christian feast of All Saints. Halloween is the time to mark the end of the harvest season and the
            arrival of a cold winter. At the same time, this is also an opportunity for us to remember together about
            the Saints, Martyrs or loved ones who have passed away. To this day, Halloween has become a popular festival
            around the world, with a large / small scale depending on the country.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>● The Origin of Halloween :</h2>
        <p>ㅤㅤ We already know what day Halloween is, but do you know the origin of this day? Actually, Halloween has
            been around 2000 years ago. This festival originated from the Celts, who lived in the lands of what is now
            Ireland, Great Britain and northern France. According to the religious beliefs of the Celts, they believed
            that on the eve of the new year, the boundary between the two worlds of yin and yang was very blurred,
            allowing the dead to return to the earthly realm. Therefore, they lit fires and dressed up in many strange
            shapes, to ward off evil spirits and welcome their lost loved ones back.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>● Meaning of Halloween :</h2>
        <p>ㅤㅤ Looking at the origins of Halloween, we can see that this is more than just a ghost festival or a
            carnival.
            Halloween is also a sacred and important religious holiday, with many profound meanings such as:</p>
        <br><b>Remembering and honoring the dead :</b>
        <p>ㅤㅤ If someone asks you what day is Halloween, what does it mean? It can be answered that this is the first
            day
            (October 31) in the series of days honoring the saints (followed by All Saints' Day, November 1), and is
            also a time for us to remember those who have passed away. (Feast of All Souls November 2nd). According to
            legend, Halloween is the day when ghosts are allowed to return to earth to visit family members. If these
            souls receive many prayers from the earth, they will soon be baptized and return to God.</p>
        <br><b>It is the day of exorcism and banishing evil things :</b>
        <p>ㅤIf talking about the meaning of warding off ghosts and evil things on Halloween, we need to tell an Irish
            legend. The story is about a dead boy named Jack. Jack's soul cannot go to heaven, because when he was
            alive, he was a very stingy, selfish person who did not know how to share with others. However, this soul
            also cannot go to hell because in life, Jack also played with demons, so the demons did not want to catch
            him.

            <br>ㅤNot wanting to see the soul of their "friend" wandering and wandering like that, the demons took some
            embers
            in Hell and put them in the pumpkin, forming a lantern to help Jack light the way. that I go. To create more
            atmosphere to keep the fire, Jack also punched holes around the squash. That is why today, pumpkin has
            become the main symbol of this occasion.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>● Fun activities on Halloween :</h2>
        <b>Masquerade Day :</b>
        <p>ㅤWhen receiving the question of what day Halloween is, people will surely think of it as a masquerade day.
            This is understandable, because the act of dressing up as your favorite characters has become a feature of
            this festival.

            <br>ㅤDressing up in a strange shape originated with the original meaning of warding off evil spirits. But
            over
            thousands of years of development, people have gradually forgotten this meaning, instead, people prefer to
            see Halloween as a more eye-catching and impressive fashion show. On this occasion, everyone can enjoy
            dressing up as their favorite models, maybe cartoon characters, maybe the main actor in a certain movie, and
            have a fun and bustling parade on the street.
            <br>ㅤWe have a <a id="linkShop" href="#Shop"> Store</a> to buy clothes if your care
        </p>

        <br>
        <b>Pumpkin carving :</b>
        <p>ㅤAfter reading the story about Jack's soul, you probably already understand what day Halloween is, why the
            pumpkin is a symbol of this day, right? Today, the activity of carving pumpkins during Halloween has
            gradually become more popular and creative. People can carve pumpkins into many different shapes, the most
            popular being the ghost face which is shaped into cute, childish expressions.</p>
        <b>Knock on the door and ask for candy:</b>
        <p>ㅤIf you ask Western children what day is Halloween, they will answer that it is the day to play the game
            "Trick or Treat". This custom began to be popular in the United States in the 1960s. On Halloween, children
            in the neighborhood often dressed up and invited each other to knock on doors to ask for candy. It is
            believed that these children are "playing" the returning souls, so giving candy also shows sharing for the
            souls of the deceased. If no candy is given, the children may play tricks and tease the host. However, to
            this day, this custom has gradually become more polite, the owners who want to give candy to the children
            will usually let them know in advance, and families who do not want to participate in this game will not be
            disturbed again.</p>
        <b>Get Apples on Halloween:</b>
        <p>ㅤThis custom originated with the Celtic people. When the land of this nation was occupied by the Romans, a
            part of Roman culture was also introduced and developed here, including the festival worshiping the goddess
            Pomona - the god of crops. According to legend, this goddess often hides in baskets of fruit, especially
            apples - a sacred fruit, often used to make offerings to the gods. Therefore, on Halloween, people often
            organize games related to apples such as taking apples in a pot of water, peeling apples, ... as a good luck
            ritual.</p>
        <b>Organize parties</b>
        <p>ㅤThe jubilant parties are indispensable on Halloween nights around the world. At these parties, you will have
            to transform into the characters you like or follow the "dresscode" set by the party owner. In Halloween
            parties, you will experience many extremely interesting games, as well as enjoy foods with bizarre shapes
            but still very eye-catching and impressive. </p>
